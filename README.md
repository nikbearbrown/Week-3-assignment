# Week 3 assignment   Nik Bear Brown


1. Use the Netflix data to create a bar chart in the SVG with release year and the number of releases
2. Create a geographic map and make bubbles or choropleth (or something more creative you can think of)
3. Use brush to filter out years on the bar chart that will change the maps as well
4. Populate the dropdown to be able to select the genre for both charts
5. Setup git to ignore .DS_Store file

## Notes 

 I wrote everything from scratch and couldn't get everything to work in one page. So I wrote some 
 indivudal pages with some of the week 2 requirements in seperate pages.  I'll make an appointment 
 with the questions that I have.
 
 
 
There is code (with no JS errors) to generate the map but it doesn't work with the bargaph so I put the bargraph on the index.html page.

*index.html*

[index](index.html) has the bar graph.


*index.html*

[map](wk3_map.html) has the map.
